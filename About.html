        <p > Hello again! Assuming you have made it this far I’m guessing you want to know a little more about me?! Well okay then!
            As I’m sure you know by now, I am studying Physics at the University of Bristol. This is without a doubt a dream come 
            true, the resources available here and the amazing people I have met have changed my outlook on how I approach physics
            as a subject and education in general. I have taken courses on a variety of physics topics including; Oscillations and
            waves, Computational Physics, Quantum mechanics, mathematical physics, Nuclear and particle physics and astronomy. 
            Not to mention the weeks I have spent conducting experiments in the lab measuring everything from the speed of light
            to the Poisson distribution of radioactive decay. Since coming to university there has not been a single area of 
            study I have not enjoyed, and after receiving a first class in my first year I am aiming to finish my masters at the same 
            level! Intertwined with my studies I have been fortunate enough to compete in an eye-opening experience, namely
            the SEDs National Rocketry Competition. Starting in the middle of lockdown my team and I managed to design a
            rocket with a payload intended to act as an early warning fire detection system (more info here). Then, while 
            still following national restrictions, we were able to produce a flight ready rocket out of composite fiberglass 
            and finally see our creation launch. All this in my first year at university has left me restless for more,
            I am eager to get stuck in to another project in whatever form may present itself.</p>

        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <dl style="padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 20px;">
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Space:</dt></br>
            <dd>Space, The final frontier. My continuing mission, to develop where no one has developed before. 
                To seek out new rockets and full flow stage combustion engine cycles. To boldly develop my skills 
                to advance where no one has advanced before. It is clear to me that the future of humanity exists 
                betwixt the stars. Already the space industry has revolutionised life on earth, from GPS to 
                understanding where the universe came from. I follow the progression of the current space industry closely. 
                The developments of starship in Texas, electron and proton in New Zealand and even Skyrora XL and Prime in our 
                very own UK. My hope is that one day I will be able to make a worthwhile contribution to the space industry and 
                develop our understanding as a people.</dd></br>
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Reading:</dt></br>
            <dd>Reading is on of my major passions. I am an avid sci-fi and fantasy reader but also love a variety of genres. 
                I have read a bit of everything but particularly enjoy philosophy, something about the way the ancient Greeks 
                present their philosophy appeals to me and although it is evident that a lot of their beliefs and morals are 
                misguided in a modern world, I do believe there is a lot to learn from the likes of Plato and Marcus Aurelius. 
                I always find my self gravitating back towards a good fantasy novel though. Nothing beats the emersion you can 
                enjoy when caught wrapped up in the adventures of a fantastical character. </dd></br>
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Model Boats:</dt></br>
            <dd>I’ve always had a fascination with the intricacy of sailing ships.
                Something about the interconnected flow of the rigging juxtaposed 
                with the solid frames and the seemingly impossibility of a mass so 
                large being able to float along the water with such grace has always 
                captivated me. I spent about a year on and off building my first model 
                boat the longboat of the HMS Endeavor. Although a smaller model, the care 
                and precision needed to bend the planks of the hull, thread the loops of 
                the sail, and sand the curves of the frame taught me a grand respect for 
                the art of ship making. A hobby I have unfortunate had to shelf as I complete 
                my degree, it is no doubt one I will pick up again later in life.</dd></br>
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Art:</dt></br>
            <dd>A large part of my free time during secondary school was spent drawing. 
                I can by no means say I am an artist with any real skill, however I have always 
                enjoyed it immensely. Imparting a vision that exists in my mind onto a page is an 
                experience unlike anything else, not knowing how a creation is going to turn out 
                until its finished always creates and sense of excitement and awe. I have dabbled 
                in a variety of art stiles from digital to acrylics. A limited few of my pieces can be seen here <inset link> </dd></br>
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Running:</dt></br>
            <dd>I started running out of a push to raise money for charity my friends and I aimed to complete my local half marathon and sought 
                sponsors along the way, I completed that race with a time of 2:18. Not incredible but I was proud none the less. I have continued 
                running to this day and have plans to complete the same race again in the near future.</dd></br>
            <dt style="  display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;">Music:</dt></br>
            <dd>I have never received any formal lesson in music, it was something that was never offered to me growing up and something only a 
                limited number of people around me pursued. Despite this I found myself an old Yamaha keyboard in the loft one day, its origins 
                to this day are undetermined, I dusted it off and began to play around with it. After practicing off and on over the course of a 
                few years I decided it was time for a new instrument. My school friend had an old guitar and we agreed to swap, he started to learn 
                keyboard and I began my adventures with the guitar. I find it a relaxing hobby and enjoy falling into learning a new song and the 
                movements that come with it. </dd></br>
