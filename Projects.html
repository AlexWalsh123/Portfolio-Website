            <h1>Project Soteria</h1>
            <h3>Developing a small scale solid G class motored rocket and 100g payload.</h3>

                Soteria the greek god of safety and salvation.

            </br></br>
                
                This is the most sophisticated project I've been involved in. We started as a small team working with the Bristol SEDs
                (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) SoC. We struggled through lockdowns and restrictions to finally
                complete and validate a design for a working rocket and payload system. We managed to launch a rocket at the end of the
                academic year. This project encapsulated a plethora of different challenges both software, hardware and personal. I am
                extremely proud of what we produced as a small independent team working out of limited resources during a pandemic.

            </br></br>

                The rocket is composed of three main parts. Firstly, the motor, which was of a G class rating and was provided to us by the SoC.
                The motor was of a particular caliber to promote the innovation in rocket body design that the competition is looking for. With
                all teams using a similar motor the performance of the rocket is based solely on how the body is designed. This leads us to the
                second part of the rocket which is the body and the construction. We decided to produce a fiberglass composite rocket using
                limited techniques available to us while the university was closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. The final part of the rocket
                is of course the payload. Due to the nature of the pandemic situation a large emphasis had been placed on payload design and
                manufacturing as these are things which can be done without access to large scale university resources. Our payload was a
                combination of flight electronics including an inertial measuring unit, GPS and radio system along with a functional payload
                designed to identify high intensity IR emissions from the ground relating to forest fires. Our nosecone was actuated to
                open on parachute descent and survey the ground beneath the rocket. A combination of computer vision software and intricate matrix 
                computation produced a 2D coordinate location of an assumed fire location with the launchpad as a point of reference. In addition 
                to building and designing, we also produced over 60 pages of detailed report following the progression of the rocket design and 
                manufacturing. This is composed of two documents a design and build report and a smaller flight report. <a href="Documents.html#soteria">
                These documents can be found <u>here.</u></a>
                
            </br></br>

                Despite unfortunately losing the rocket upon ascent, we learned an incredible amount about flight systems, aerodynamics, electronics, 
                and team management. We as a team continue to explore what we can accomplish and aim to fly another rocket this academic year.
