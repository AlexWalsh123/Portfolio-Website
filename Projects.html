            <h1>Project Soteria</h1>
            <h3>Developing a small scale solid G class motored rocket and 100g payload.</h3>   

            <img  src="Img/Launching.jpg" style=" float: right; width:40%; height:40%; margin: 2%; margin-bottom: 4%;">

            <p>
                
                Soteria the greek god of safety and salvation.

            </br></br>
                
                This is the most sophisticated project I've been involved in. We started as a small team working with the Bristol SEDs
                (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) SoC. We struggled through lockdowns and restrictions to finally
                complete and validate a design for a working rocket and payload system. We managed to launch a rocket at the end of the
                academic year. This project encapsulated a plethora of different challenges both software, hardware and personal. I am
                extremely proud of what we produced as a small independent team working out of limited resources during a pandemic.

            </br></br>

                The rocket is composed of three main parts. Firstly, the motor, which was of a G class rating and was provided to us by the SoC.
                The motor was of a particular caliber to promote the innovation in rocket body design that the competition is looking for. With
                all teams using a similar motor the performance of the rocket is based solely on how the body is designed. This leads us to the
                second part of the rocket which is the body and the construction. We decided to produce a fiberglass composite rocket using
                limited techniques available to us while the university was closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. The final part of the rocket
                is of course the payload. Due to the nature of the pandemic situation a large emphasis had been placed on payload design and
                manufacturing as these are things which can be done without access to large scale university resources. Our payload was a
                combination of flight electronics including an inertial measuring unit, GPS and radio system along with a functional payload
                designed to identify high intensity IR emissions from the ground relating to forest fires. Our nosecone was actuated to
                open on parachute descent and survey the ground beneath the rocket. A combination of computer vision software and intricate matrix 
                computation produced a 2D coordinate location of an assumed fire location with the launchpad as a point of reference. In addition 
                to building and designing, we also produced over 60 pages of detailed report following the progression of the rocket design and 
                manufacturing. This is composed of two documents a design and build report and a smaller flight report. <a href="Documents.html#soteria">
                These documents can be found <u>here.</u></a>
                
            </br></br>

                Despite unfortunately losing the rocket upon ascent, we learned an incredible amount about flight systems, aerodynamics, electronics, 
                and team management. We as a team continue to explore what we can accomplish and aim to fly another rocket this academic year.

            <h1>Project Mimir</h1>
            <h3>Developing a portfolio website to demonstrate my abilities across a variety of areas. </h3> 

            <p> Mimir a figure in Norse mythology, renowned for his knowledge and wisdom.

            </br></br>

            This project is something I've been aiming to achieve for a while. My first experience with web development came early in secondary school where we 
            dabbled with basics in a IT lesson. Since then, I've been thinking on and off about developing my own websites as a form of interactive CV and portfolio. 
            I believe this is a great method of expressing myself in a informal environment while still portraying enough formality to appeal two perspective employers. 
            I set out to hand code this website from scratch and have accomplished just that. More than 1000 lines of HTML and CSS combined I finally finished a first 
            draft of a website that I can be happy with I don't doubt that over the coming years it will continue to develop and grow as I continue to develop and grow 
            my career as a physicist and engineer.

            </br></br>

            In this project I want to create a space where I could list my personal projects that I completed in my free time along with formal work experience I have 
            had in the past. In addition, I have included an about section to give the reader an idea of who I am and what is his I strive to accomplish. I have compiled 
            a range of images and documents to present here she reflects my personality and skills.

            </br></br>

            There are many challenges in development of this website, such as learning how to organize a HTML page, styling set page with CSS and trying to clear instruct 
            which could easily be followed so the user can enjoy an experience of navigating the pitch. I used Visual Studio code as my main IDE along with GitHub desktop 
            to insure my work was correctly formatted and stored in an easily accessible space. An additional benefit to using GitHub is that of GitHub pages a free method 
            of hosting my website and the supporting code. This project has been demanding but he's given me invaluable insight into the way the web is formatted and driven. 
            please feel free to access the website source code on my GitHub linked here to gain a better understanding of how this page was created.

            <h1>Project Dionysus</h1>
            <h3>Developing small scale games using a variety of software.</h3> 
            <p> 

                Dionysus, the god of festivity and theatre.

            </br></br>

            This project began during my A-level computer science classes where we were assigned a task to create a piece of software with an engaging function. 
            Evidently the definition of engaging function covers a broad area but for me, someone who has spent a lot of time playing video games recreationally, 
            I figured what better to develop then something I can be passionate about and have experience using. Thus, I decided to develop for my project a game 
            that would be reflection of what it is I enjoy as well as being something that could be accomplished within the scope of an a-level class. One of my 
            favorite games growing up was a game called Dragon Quest, specifically the 9th Dragon Quest on the DS. Being arguably my favorite game but also a 
            relatively simple 2D RPG I decided it was a great candidate for a style to emulate for my own project. Over the course of the following year, I dedicated 
            a portion of my time to developing this game. I managed to produce a working Dragon Quest style fighting mechanic and an explorable 2D world with random 
            encounters. The project now had a structured game engine for which to add content to however due to the nature of the project being a coding one and 
            the fact that all it needed now was art, characters, and world building, this is where the project drew to a close for the purposes of my class. After 
            finishing six form I decided to spend my summer developing a new game this time in 3D providing a whole host of new challenges.

            </br></br>
            


            Developing a new three game was a very different challenge as most of my world would now be built in 3D rather than simple 2D pixel drawings. 
            This began my first introduction to the 3D modeling software blender. In blender I developed a sailing ship as a test ground for how to use the 
            software. From reading my about section you may know of my interest in sailing ships. In tandem to this interest comes that of the pirate setting, 
            a time where the primary vessel was a sailing ship. Having built in blender a 3D model of a ship I decided the next project would be one of a 
            pirate’s style ship fighting arena combat game. I also endeavored to create an upgradeable hometown where you could develop new materials and buildings 
            to upgrade your ships with. To start though I had to develop a system for naval combat, this used a variety of ship movement controls real game object 
            projectiles and the custom developed enemy AI system to create engaging combatants. After this I created an upgrades screen where you could customize 
            your boat using currency you have collected when destroying enemy vessels to increase parameters such as your whole strength and cannon power. I then 
            began attempting to create a small town with layered customizable buildings and layouts. I created a few models for various buildings and had a general 
            idea of what I was going to implement. However, the start of the university term was soon approaching, and I shelved this project as I began my studies. 
            I endeavor to one day pick up where I left off and continue development of this game however my current responsibilities to university and to my 
            extracurricular activities require it to stay shelved for now.

            <p> 
                A simple project conceptualized to help gain an understanding of AutoCAD and how it can be used practically. 
                I designs in AutoCAD a shuttle design for a wooden coaster with a hexagonal shape. I then utilized a combination of 
                CorelDraw and JobControl two laser cut these designs. I went through 3 iterations and the final coaster was given 
                a layer varnish and can be seen here after copious use!
