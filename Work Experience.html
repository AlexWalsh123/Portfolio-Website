            <h1>Bookseller, Waterstones St. Albans</h1>
            <p> I worked as a bookseller at my local Waterstones store during my alevels. not only did this help me develop 
                time management and organization skills due to studying five days a week then working in additional two days 
                on the weekend, But I also gained some invaluable skills from my time spent interacting with customers, 
                organizing the store and working closely with colleagues. My time at Waterstones was extremely fulfilling 
                and provided me with a great basis for entering a working environment. I was trusted with keys to open and 
                close the store and banking to ensure on hand petty cash was correctly managed. I even had the opportunity 
                to train new staff and work across a variety of stores within the management cluster. 

            </br></br>

                Due to my position, I had access to a store discount meaning I could dramatically increase the availability of 
                any book titles I was interested in. Ultimately this led to being able to read a variety interesting fiction and 
                nonfiction which I otherwise wouldn't have considered. Spending so much time in a book shop gave me insight into 
                the world of literature. I developed my likes and dislikes and compounded on my already existing love of reading. 
                I am grateful for the opportunity to have works alongside amazing colleagues to not only further my working abilities 
                but also develop my personal taste in reading.

            <p> 
                As part of my Duke of Edinburgh award I participated in six months of volunteering at a local Oxfam book shop, 
                this led the way for my development of customer relationship skills and general retail experience. I developed 
                a close rapport with recurring customers and gained intimacy with the operations of running a small business.

            <p>
                During the summer I worked part time at a logistical company where I gained additional team working skills and 
                learned the nuance of working in a large company. My time was spent organizing and categorizing as well as 
                accumulating and distributing. I consider this a valuable experience which is given me great insight into the 
                functioning and organization of a large business.
